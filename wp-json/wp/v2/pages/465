In 2004, she had her first individual exhibition at the Claude Samuel gallery in Paris as part of the Polish year in France, &#8222;Nowa Polska&#8221;. PhD student at the Warsaw Academy of Fine Arts under dr hab. Stanis\u0142aw Brach, professor at the Academy of Fine Arts (2011-2016). She participated in the International Ceramics and Sculpture Symposium at the International Center of Ceramics in Boles\u0142awiec (2013). She had an individual exhibition &#8222;Amnesia&#8221; during the opening of her doctoral studies as part of the NIGHT OF THE MUSEUMS of 2015, in the courtyard of the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw. She defended her PhD thesis on: MEMORY\/AMNESIA\/IDENTITY (2018).<\/p>\n<p>The subject of artistic research: HUMAN BEING: BURNING, MANEKINES, MARGINES, MEMORY AND LACK OF MEMORY, AMNESIA OR MANIPULATION. The extensive subject of memory poses the questions: where do I come from? Where am I going? Who am I? \u2013 Therefore, the problems of identity and meaning. It covers a spectrum of problems from history through philosophy and sociology to anthropology &#8211; it is always very current, it is at the center of debates and contemporary contemplation. The visual form, tangible or verbal &#8211; is one of the rare means of expressing traces left by various Forms of Remembrance &#8211; guarantees of any identity. This matter became the ground for which a new series of sculptures from ceramics and porcelain was born. After the period of introducing the &#8222;world upside down&#8221; during the opening of her doctoral studies in 2015, Sophie Maslowski now shows a series of sculptures on the subject of individual, collective, organic, cellular, atavistic memory &#8230; In recent years, she has had seven individual exhibitions in Poland and France, and participated in several dozen group exhibitions in Poland and abroad.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>French-Polish artist, born in France.
